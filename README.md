# Fog Burner

A simple status bar application for OS X Yosemite that prevents your Mac from
going to sleep or dimming its screen. This is useful if you're on battery
power but want to temporarily keep your screen on without keyboard input.

By default, Fog Burner leaves your screen on until it is disabled, but you can
set a preset or custom amount of time for your Energy Saving settings to resume
as per normal.

## Building

Fog Burner is developed on OS X Yosemite (using Swift) and Xcode 6.1.
It targets **OS X Yosemite only**.

There aren't any external dependencies or any weird things; you should be able
to clone the repo, open the Xcode project file, and compile!
